# Munch

Application Development 2 final project. It's a online restaurant application based on flutter.

## Requirement for the project

When you design an application, discuss with your team members or use mind map
to analyze who could be your potential clients. For example, in case of blood
donation app, there could be different users such as donor, receiver, and blood
bank. Here, you have to create three different portals for various users. Then the
options for the users should be sign-up, register/modify the profile, sign-in, landing
on home page, etc. User data should be validated and authenticated to provide
security. Most importantly, the app should contain minimum of 12 screen flows.
(As I'm doing this alone, it may vary.)
    
## How to use

To run this application or cloning it, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your computer.
